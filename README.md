# 🚦 Traffic Light Control System

**Don’t Throw, Re-Grow**

A simple electronics project that demonstrates how a traffic light system works using basic components.  
This project is part of **Electro Rescue**, focusing on learning electronics through practical implementation.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The Traffic Light Control System simulates a real-world traffic signal using LEDs.  
It helps beginners understand timing control, digital outputs, and sequential logic in electronics.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand basic traffic light operation
- Learn timing and sequence control
- Practice wiring LEDs and resistors
- Build a real-life inspired electronics system

---

## 🔧 Components Used
- Arduino Uno  
- Red, Yellow, and Green LEDs  
- Resistors (220Ω – 330Ω)  
- Breadboard  
- Jumper wires  
- USB cable / Power supply  

---

## 🔌 Working Principle
The system turns ON LEDs in a fixed sequence:
1. **Red LED** – Stop  
2. **Yellow LED** – Ready  
3. **Green LED** – Go  

Each LED remains ON for a predefined time before switching to the next, mimicking a real traffic signal.

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes
- LED control using digital pins
- Delay-based timing logic
- Understanding real-world signal systems
- Basic troubleshooting of circuits
